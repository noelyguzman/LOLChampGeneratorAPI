# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Noely Guzman

Time spent: 9 hours spent in total

## Summary

League of Legends Champion's Passive Generator is an android app that randomly genrates the champions from Riot's League of Legends along with their passive by just clciking a button. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üò≠üêâüå†

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is Riot's League of Legneds.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:
